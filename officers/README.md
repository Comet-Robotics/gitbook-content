* The executive board must be listed.
*   The board also needs to have up-to-date organization contact information (i.e. contact email

    address, social media accounts, website, etc.)
* General organization meetings, times, and dates should also be listed.
* Boards should also list the organization's purpose or mission statement.
*   Individual event posters or flyers must be removed the first business day after the event has

    been completed.

## Digital Signage

Digital signage allows student organizations to use digital displays on campus to advertise their student organization.&#x20;

* Advertisements will run for 14 days
* You can continuously request that advertisements be put out but this is discouraged by the SOC
* Instead, try to use digital signage for specific events, giving at least a week gap between advertisements
