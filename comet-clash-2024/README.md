## For Competitors

### Waivers and Registration Fees

Every robot must have a registration fee paid in order to compete at the event. You may pay online using [this link](https://comet-robotics.square.site/product/comet-clash-2024-robot-registration-fee/8?cs=true\&cst=popular). Alternatively, we will take cash and card payments in-person during check-in.

All competitors must sign a waiver before competing. We will have physical waivers available on-site to complete, or you can print and sign your waiver ahead of time. Minors must be under the supervision of an adult during the entire event, and provide a completed minor waiver, signed by an adult.

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/Release-and-Indemnification-Agreement-for-Minors.pdf" %}

For all other competitors, this waiver must be completed.

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/Release-and-Indemnification-Agreement-for-Adults.pdf" %}

### Robot Requirements

Robots must meet the [SPARC Robot Construction Specifications](https://sparc.tools/). In addition, no fire weapons or ICE (Internal Combustion Engines). No projectiles of any kind. No Chemical Propulsion (i.e. Rocket, Thermal, or jet). Weapon locks must be used while the bot is outside of the arena. Maximum weight bonus for beetles is limited to 150% (4.5 lbs).

### Judging Format

Judges decisions are final. Judges will score based on the new [SPARC Damage and Engagement judging criteria](https://sparc.tools/SPARC_Judging_Guidelines_v1.2.pdf). Note that this is a recent revision to the SPARC judging ruleset (v1.2, revised on 9/8/2024) with significant implications to judges' decisions. If you are unfamiliar with the revisions, we highly encourage you review them before the event.

### Prizes

Trophies are awarded to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for each weight class (plant, ant, beetle). Other special awards may be awarded during the event.&#x20;

For each weight class, the 1st place winner will receive a **$40 Repeat Robotics gift card**, with 2nd and 3rd place winners receiving a **$20 Repeat Robotics gift card**! Huge thanks to _Repeat Robotics_ for providing these prizes.

(Other prizes may be available, update when finalized)

### Pit Setup

Tables and chairs will be provided. Please note that the pit area is on the floor above the competition area. You will need to use stairs or elevators to get to the pits.

Battery charging is permitted in any location as long as they are in battery bags and the battery charger is plugged directly into a socket, not an extension cord or power strip.

Soldering is not permitted in the pits area. Signage will direct competitors to the Electronics Workshop on the same floor as the competition, where soldering is permitted. Soldering equipment is available but you should bring your own consumables.

### Battle Box

The main competition box has an 8 foot x 8 foot floor area. The kickplates are 2x4, and are recessed into the floor so forks can't get stuck under them. There will be a 4 foot x 4 foot box available for testing.

### Quick Rules Recap

* 5 second pins, no weight bonuses, 1 unstick per bot if stuck on the arena. Exposed battery is a KO, 5-6-6 judging format.
* Specifically for the plastic antweight competition, your bots MUST be 3d printed.
* 1 unstick per bot per fight if it is stuck in the arena. Examples include: Stuck in the wall, stuck in the floor, etc. Unsticks will not be given for bots who are upside down or tipped up against the arena wall.
