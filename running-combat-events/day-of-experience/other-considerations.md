# Other Considerations

## Volunteer Communication during event

For your organizers/volunteer team - ???

For announcing stuff to participants - Discord, PA

## Directional Signage

Directional signage could be very helpful depending on your venue setup. Comet Clash had pits and competition area split across 2 floors, so we had signage pointing people to staircases, elevators, and other key locations in the venue.

If possible, outdoor a-frames or yard signs pointing people from parking lots to your venue could be helpful to participants.

## Media

Live stream? Record matches? Photos? Speaker setup for announcements?

## Prizes

## After your event
