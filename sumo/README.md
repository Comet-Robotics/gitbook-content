description: A brief overview of the systems that make up a sumo bot

# Introduction

This tutorial is aimed at teaching newcomers to Comet Sumo all of the essential things one needs to know about designing a sumo robot from start to finish.  At its core, a sumo robot can be broken up into three subsystems: mechanical, electrical and software. First, the mechanical system is the structure and body of the robot, the robot’s chassis in other words. Then, the electrical system represents the vital organs that supply power to all parts of the robot. Lastly, the software side is the soul of the robot, how it will seek to outmaneuver the opponent in a fight. &#x20;

Which portion of the tutorial you’ll be mainly following depends on which team you are working on, but it is recommended to also learn how the other systems play a part in a robot as there is often collaboration between teams!&#x20;
