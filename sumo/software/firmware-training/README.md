This section covers the basics of C++ programming on microcontrollers using the Arduino framework and is encouraged for members new to programming on embedded systems. We will cover topics such as polling, interrupts, pulse width modulation (PWM), communication protocols such as I2C, as well as implementing a state machine software model. &#x20;
