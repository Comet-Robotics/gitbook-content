# IR/RF Remote

It's often the case we want quickly stop or start our sumo bot both before and after the match. In 3kg sumo, this is most definitely needed as robots in this division can move extremely quick.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
RoboGames rules for autonomous sumo classes prohibits the use of remote control during the match.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Wireless remote control can be done in two ways: with infrared (IR) or radio frequency (RF) receivers and transmitters. On our robot, we will need to attach a receiver to its board while a remote (the transmitter) is controlled by the person holding it. We do not have any specific recommendations for receivers/transmitters, but I would recommend this [robot start module ](https://www.jsumo.com/microstart-sumo-minisumo-robot-start-module)JSUMO sells that makes starting/stopping your robot simple in case you don't want to deal additional electronics and soldering. &#x20;

On a side note, if you are buying an RF transmitter and receiver pair make sure they work in an available unlicensed operating frequency according to [ISM radio bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM\_radio\_band#Frequency\_allocations).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Two popular frequency bands in the U.S. are 2.4GHz and 915MHz bands. 2.4GHz is the frequency we use in combat robotics!
