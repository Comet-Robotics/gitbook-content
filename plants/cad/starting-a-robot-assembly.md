# Starting a Robot Assembly

Enough exposition, let's get to the good stuff. In this tutorial, we will start a bot that we will CAD together that we're creatively calling "Combat Bot". Combat Bot will be a fully functioning push bot, so we're not adding an active weapon yet. The first step is to create a new assembly:\


* Open Solidworks
* Under 'New' click 'Assembly'



When we start an assembly this way, Solidworks prompts us to open existing parts or assemblies to instert into our new assembly. We don't want to do this, so click through these prompts by hitting the **X**:

Let's save our new assembly before we do anything else.&#x20;
