# (Recommended) Sharepoint Setup

While it may not seem as important right now, Comet Robotics has a Sharepoint that you will learn to love with time. The trick is getting it setup and behaving at the start.\
\
The Sharepoint lets us:

* Share CAD files with each other
* See past semester Plants and what other members are up to with their designs
* Share your CAD files between devices
* Access our CAD library, which holds CAD files of components for you to drop into your robot design
* Archive our robots for future generations of roboticists' to look at



## Getting started

On a Windows computer:

* Hit the Windows key
* Type "school account"
* Select "Email & accounts"

Once the settings window opens, if you aren't signed in to your UTD account (Shown below), hit the "Add a work or school account" button and sign in to your UTD email.

Once you have signed in to your UTD account on windows, add this account to your Onedrive.&#x20;

* Hit the Windows key
* Type "onedrive"
* Open the Onedrive app - file explorer should open

You should see at least one account in the top left of file explorer. Here's what mine looks like:\

There are too many variables involved for me to address everything you'd have to do to add your UTD Onedrive account here if it doesn't show up, but you may have luck clicking the onedrive icon that appears in the tray (bottom right corner of your task bar), which should open the Onedrive settings. From here, you can hit add account and follow the instructions.&#x20;



## Adding the Sharepoint shortcut

Now that Onedrive is added, open up the Comet Robotics discord server. If you have the member role, you should see the channel #member-resources under the 'SERVER' category (where announcements is). In member resources, there is a link to the Sharepoint. If you are visiting it for the first time, there is a 'request access' button which will notify all the officers. Once you've been accepted by an officer, navigating to that link will show you a page similar to this:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Navigate to documents using the left-hand tabs, then right click the Combat Robotics folder and select "Add shortcut to OneDrive".&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

That's it! The Combat Robotics folder will now show up in your UTD Onedrive folder on your PC. To see where Plants are, follow this directory:

> C:\Users\USER\OneDrive - The University of Texas at Dallas\Combat Robotics\Design Files\\.Plants

Here you'll see folders for other robots. We'll cover the naming scheme in the next tutorial. If you read this far, thank you. You get a free lollipop. üç≠
