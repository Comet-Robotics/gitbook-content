# Robot Ownership for Club Funded Bots

In general, any parts paid for by Comet Robotics remain under the ownership of  the club. Club members are able to loan parts owned by the club for use in their own robots. These parts will count against your budget.



All members are allowed to work on a Plastic Ant-weight (Plant) project individually. They will be supplied filament for 3D printing and a standardized set of electronics to use in their Plant.

To build a full combat robot, any member must meet these requirements;

* Must have built a Plant
* Must have competed in at least 3 separate events with the same Plant
* Must iterate and improve the design of the Plant between events

After completing these requirements they can begin to work on a full combat robot. They will not be given any funding for the bot until the design passes a design review check by the Combat Officers. Full Combat Ants(1lb) will be given $250 for their budget, Beetles(3lb) will be given $550 for their budget, and Hobbies(12lb) will be given $1000.

Ants can be worked on individually, Beetles require a team of at least 2 people, Hobbies require a team of at least 2 people. The club will try to provide funding for 4 Ants and 2 Beetles per semester and 1 Hobby per academic year.



Club members can purchase parts from the club at the price they were originally bought at, and those parts are now owned by the member.&#x20;

When a bot retires, one copy of the shell goes to the club member and one copy of the shell goes to the club to put on display. All the electronic parts will be removed from the retired bot and returned to the clubs inventory of parts for future bots to use.
