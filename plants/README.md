# Combat Robot Weight Classes

## Combat Robot Classes

Combat Robots compete against other robots of the same class. Classes are categories for different weights, weapon types, and materials.



### Maximum weight per class

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Class</th><th>Weight</th><th data-hidden></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fairyweight</td><td>150 grams (0.33lbs)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Antweight</strong></td><td>1lb (455 grams)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Beetleweight</td><td>3lb (1361 grams)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hobbyweight</td><td>12lbs / 15lb</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Featherweight</td><td>30lb</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lightweight</td><td>60lb</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Middleweight</td><td>120lb</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Heavyweight</td><td>220lb / 250lb</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
The Battlebots you see on TV are 250lb robots!
{% endhint %}



### Class modifiers

Robots can further be broken down into these categories:

* Full Combat
* Sportsman
* **Plastic**
* ...





For the purposes of our Plant series, we'll focus on the Antweight and Plastic classes. Antweights are 1lb combat robots. Plastics allow only certain 3D printed materials, usually PLA, ABS, and PETG. We'll dive deeper into 3D printing later, but for now just know that your robot will be 1lb and mostly 3D printed.
